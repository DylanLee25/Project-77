        <h1>Project on console</h1>
        <h3>Visual Studio is an offline IDE. You set it up by downloading the app, then creating a new folder to work on, and then adding the html, javascript, and css files to your project.</h3>
    <h3>The console screen shows you what you write in the javascript file. You can use the console screen to see what is going in the background. You open the console screen by right clicking on the web page, clicking inspect, and clicking on the word console. You can print anything on the console by typing in the script tag or in the javascript file.</h3>
